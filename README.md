# Overview

This program is a virtual butterfly creator. You start with 4 default butterflies and can breed those butterflies for random mutations. You are also able to remove butterflies based on their specific aspects.

I wrote this program to learn C++. I decided to create a random butterfly creator because I thought it would be a good way to introduce myself to classes in this language. The breeding and removing aspects of this program were added so I could learn how this language uses lists.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
